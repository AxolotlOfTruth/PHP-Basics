# PHP-Basics
You need php installed an a web server running in this folder for everything to work properly. 
Since this was more about me playing with PHP than a HTML-CSS-PHP exercise, I didn't really make the output pretty or anything. So if you want to understand what i'm doing, check the comments on the source code.
